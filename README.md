# Assignment 1
## Introduction
Hi I’m **Sarah**
I like to like to do things with my hands, fixing, building or creating different things. From building something out of wood, fabric, yarn along with many other things.  You might catch me painting the house one day and running wire in it the next.  Always interested in learning new things.
I’m currently learning **Mobile App Development**- while getting ready to take my exams for -**Salesforce Administrator**-, -**AWS Solutions Architect**- and -**Azure Foundations**-.  Trying to find that one thing that is grab me as what I want to commit to.  They all intergrate with each other in some form or another.

I've done everything from running the cables, managing the network, building the servers.  Administrator for Windows servers several versions, VMS, AS400, Linux and database management.  The more of the different systems, programs, frameworks that you know the better decisions you can making them work together.
